  <h2><u>CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY</u></h2>

  <p>This is one of my most favourite books I have read till now. It is the story of a boy who wins once in a million chance to visit the the most famous chocolate factory.</p>
  <p>The story starts with the introduction of the protagonist's family , he lives with his mother, father, maternal grand-parents and paternal grand-parents, in a very tiny house.</p>
  <p>And one day the famous and mysterious Mr. Willy Wonka declares that he has set up five Golden Tickets and those kids who get it can visit his chocolate factory along with one family member.</p>
  <p>And Charlie finds one of the tickets and takes his gradpa joe who once worked for Willy Wonka before the factory workers were fired from their jobs.</p>
  <p>On the day of the visit he finds out the other four kids who would go aong him for the visit.</p>
  <p>Veruca Salt is a wealthy, rude girl, Agustus Gloop is a big fatty who keeps on munching, Violet Beauregarde is chewing gum champion and Mike Tevee is viodeo game addict kid.</p>
  <p>Because of the hasty behaviours all the four except Charlie fall into various troubles during the factory tour. And in the end Mr. Wonka decides that the next heir to his business would be Charlie as he was a good and smart kid.</p>
